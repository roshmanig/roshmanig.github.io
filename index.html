										<p>Name: Roshan Titus</p>
										<p>Email: s3791781@student.rmit.edu.au</p?>
										<p>I am Indian, but I was born and raised in Melbourne. I live in the northern suburbs and went to both primary school and high school. I graduated from highschool last year and ended up taking a Bachelor of IT Degree here are RMIT. I enjoy the Indian side of my heritage and love the food, I can speak a language called Malayalam but am pretty hopeless with reading or writing it. My hobbies include tennis, anything social, games and just chilling. I just recently got a puppy who is about 8 months old now. His name is Chance and he’s a Border Collie Mix.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
										<p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
										<p>I mean, I'm Indian, so the odds were stacked against me for in interest in IT. It was either this or a taxi driver. I’ve always enjoyed the IT side of things while growing up and in school. My interest in IT started with my family’s first HP desktop which had some games like Age of Empires and Pinball. From then on, I always found it easy to troubleshoot or understand minor issues and as I became more interested in games, this overall interest in IT grew. While in school, I met many friends who played the same games as me and these friendships grew over the years. Eventually in highschool a couple of my friends and I decided that we should pick-up Computing in year 11. Although, I ended up dropping it a semester later. Later on, while deciding my Degree, a couple of my friends said they were thinking about Computer Science and IT so I gave it a look and thought that it would fit what enjoy doing. Eventually, I’ve build my own PC from scratch, began learning to code and more!</p>
										<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
										<p>To be honest, throughout my entire year 12 year, I always had the thought of doing pursuing a Degree in Law or Psychology. For my first round offer I got my first preference which was Psychology at La Trobe. I ended up putting IT at RMIT as the next preference for the second round and got that too. From there, I decided that the location and number of friends who are attending RMIT would be better for me as well as the fact that I felt like I’d enjoy IT more than Psych. I also heard that it’s more hands on and practical at RMIT, which is something I felt I could connect to more on a learning level.</p>
										<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
										<p>I hope to understand computer systems, languages including python and Java as well as coherently be able to execute commands or understand coding somewhat. I would like to understand user development and design as well as my future job prospects that come with graduating with this IT degree.</p>

										<h2 class="major">The Ideal Job</h2>
										<p>To find my idea of an 'ideal job' click or highlight the link: https://www.seek.com.au/job/38613592?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=e20b1e55-e524-4010-a2b2-4dc78a984b71</p>
										<p>This job involves the need for experienced IT personnel to be able to understand the many aspects involved being a Head of IT in an IT company. This includes various challenges like Maintaining a balance between technical possibility and commercial reality for both IT and Digital Services, managing priorities across a diverse stakeholder group, creating consistent systems & practices across an association/not-for profit. It requires a hands-on approach to the company’s technical issues, which is very appealing to me. The most appealing factors involved with this particular job pertain to the pay and level of which the job is at – 130K – 150K. The head of IT role would allow me to be in charge of my own team, overlooking work and progress as well as the opportunity to work closely with clients to have their visions and jobs to be carried out. Being full time, it would allow for a clear conscious of job security and also being located in the CBD allows for a short commute without the need for a car to get to work.</p>
										<p>This job would require a foundation as a senior operational IT proficient in a medium monetarily centred association. A capacity to include an incentive over the whole Digital Services and IT Portfolio. Demonstrated involvement in making generally speaking innovation and computerized methodology, overseeing client administration improvement, creating and executing new programming and equipment arrangements, overseeing application programming and equipment merchants, assembling a high performing group, empowering change, driving operational and process efficiencies, and building the certainty and trust of an extremely different senior partner gathering. In saying all this, I currently lack most if not all of the required to take on a position such as this. This job is of a very high stature and would require quite a lot of prior experience in the IT field to even be viable as a candidate. My path to pursue this career would involve graduating from my IT course, and finding a job somewhere in the field to begin building a repertoire with the knowledge that would allow me to take on a position like this. This would also involve taking a manager course, which would train me how to lead people and take control of a team with efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

											<h3 class="major">PROGJECT IDEA: Chatterbot For The Visually Impaired</h3>
											<p>PROJECT IDEA: Chatterbot for the visually impaired is a UI that would allow speech-to-text and text-to-speech between the user and the User’s system of choice, be it a phone or computer. This would be primarily for the visually impaired, as a simple and easy way to overcome the visual aspects of any system by simply issuing commands with speech recognition software, in which the system is able to understand speech and carry out the command with ease. It is evident that although there has been some progression with ‘blind mode’ on the iPhones for instance, there is a lack of auditory aid to assist those who are visually impaired. This idea would allow for coherent speech patterns between the bot and user, as well as a large database of vocabulary and keywords that it can use to understand different users, pick up accents, speech patterns, focus on voice rather than ambient sound and accessibility. This is not a simple chat-bot, and its primary focus is to be extraordinarily functional and to help users in doing various tasks. The software is a digital assistant that is able to understand, think and also learn from its experience just like a human brain. Like many cutting-edge software, voice assistants are powered by narrow artificial intelligence, the kind of AI that is extremely efficient at performing specific tasks, but unable to make general, abstract decisions like the human mind.</p>
											<p>The main issue that comes with a Chatterbot UI would be the lack of coherent speech patterns when the bot responds to the users input, which makes the project interesting. How do we find a way to have coherent speech between the bot and User with little if not any errors in recognition? As you may have experienced with similar UI such as Siri from Apple, a coherent speech pattern is often uncommon to come across as the UI needs to piece together words to formulate a sentence back to the user. This project would tackle this issue, in a way that would allow coherent speech by saving sentences of speech, or recalling already used answers to evolve and expand an already large bank of responses and words. This is slowly coming to fruition as we have largely successful UI’s such as Google Now, Siri or Cortana. The need for voice assistants grow more and more useful for everyone, from the visually impaired to the visually able. The capabilities of these assistants showcase the efficiency in simple voice command over physically typing or searching for something. It is a matter of time, and that’s what makes this so interesting. As technology grows, the more efficiency is becoming more effective, less button presses, less screens and tabs, faster information and responses, no clutter. As we move forward, it is time that we stop assuming that everyone is physically capable, we should cater for those who aren’t, and we can start with this Chatterbot. For example, with this UI, emails can be read out by the system, in which there is no need to zoom or view the email. This allows the user to simply hear what their email is about, but without miscommunication of separate words being joined together to make a sentence, it will be read consistently. Or another example could involve, reading the News, instead of having to read the article, a User simply asks the system for the latest news and then is alerted with prompts and responses. This would also allow for accessibility to other parts of systems that may have previously been a hassle for visually impaired users to reach. By using command prompts, such as ‘open Word’ the User does not need to remember or search for the app, they can just prompt the system to open the application. This can be added upon further by allowing the user to simply dictate what they would like to write in word with their speech, instead of typing.</p>
											<p>The software that would be required to allow this project to take flight would involve a human language interface, automation and voice recognition software for Windows PC, as a starting point. This software would have to be multi-functional AI software that allows you to interact with your computer using voice commands in most of the languages of the world. It must be able to understand different speech patterns, accents and languages to gauge and react to the User’s prompts.</p>
											<p>The skill required to be involved in this project would involve strong coding knowledge and understanding, experience in coding and using AI, voice recognition software and knowledge and software development. It would be very feasible to find people whose skills and experience match this criterion as there are several UI’s of a similar nature.</p>
											<p>With a fully coherent and functional UI like described, the developmental impact would be immeasurable. By having a fully automated UI like this, it would open up technology as whole to a whole new audience, with less awkwardness or fear of use. This would increase functionality of different systems by tenfold, by allowing efficient ways for the User to interact with the systems and for the systems to learn and cater to the User. It would solve any previous problem for the visually impaired, allowing them to use a system almost to its full potential with little to no disadvantage compared to someone who is visually able. If this project is successful, we would be left with a life changing way to interact with the technology that surrounds us in this day and age. By having different systems understand prompts, it would eliminate the tedious tasks often found when manually handling something. This can be transferred to anything, from home appliances to a hands-free car experience.</p>
