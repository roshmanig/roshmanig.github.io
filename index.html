											<h3 class="major">PROGJECT IDEA: Chatterbot For The Visually Impaired</h3>
											<p>PROJECT IDEA: Chatterbot for the visually impaired is a UI that would allow speech-to-text and text-to-speech between the user and the User’s system of choice, be it a phone or computer. This would be primarily for the visually impaired, as a simple and easy way to overcome the visual aspects of any system by simply issuing commands with speech recognition software, in which the system is able to understand speech and carry out the command with ease. It is evident that although there has been some progression with ‘blind mode’ on the iPhones for instance, there is a lack of auditory aid to assist those who are visually impaired. This idea would allow for coherent speech patterns between the bot and user, as well as a large database of vocabulary and keywords that it can use to understand different users, pick up accents, speech patterns, focus on voice rather than ambient sound and accessibility. This is not a simple chat-bot, and its primary focus is to be extraordinarily functional and to help users in doing various tasks. The software is a digital assistant that is able to understand, think and also learn from its experience just like a human brain. Like many cutting-edge software, voice assistants are powered by narrow artificial intelligence, the kind of AI that is extremely efficient at performing specific tasks, but unable to make general, abstract decisions like the human mind.</p>
											<p>The main issue that comes with a Chatterbot UI would be the lack of coherent speech patterns when the bot responds to the users input, which makes the project interesting. How do we find a way to have coherent speech between the bot and User with little if not any errors in recognition? As you may have experienced with similar UI such as Siri from Apple, a coherent speech pattern is often uncommon to come across as the UI needs to piece together words to formulate a sentence back to the user. This project would tackle this issue, in a way that would allow coherent speech by saving sentences of speech, or recalling already used answers to evolve and expand an already large bank of responses and words. This is slowly coming to fruition as we have largely successful UI’s such as Google Now, Siri or Cortana. The need for voice assistants grow more and more useful for everyone, from the visually impaired to the visually able. The capabilities of these assistants showcase the efficiency in simple voice command over physically typing or searching for something. It is a matter of time, and that’s what makes this so interesting. As technology grows, the more efficiency is becoming more effective, less button presses, less screens and tabs, faster information and responses, no clutter. As we move forward, it is time that we stop assuming that everyone is physically capable, we should cater for those who aren’t, and we can start with this Chatterbot. For example, with this UI, emails can be read out by the system, in which there is no need to zoom or view the email. This allows the user to simply hear what their email is about, but without miscommunication of separate words being joined together to make a sentence, it will be read consistently. Or another example could involve, reading the News, instead of having to read the article, a User simply asks the system for the latest news and then is alerted with prompts and responses. This would also allow for accessibility to other parts of systems that may have previously been a hassle for visually impaired users to reach. By using command prompts, such as ‘open Word’ the User does not need to remember or search for the app, they can just prompt the system to open the application. This can be added upon further by allowing the user to simply dictate what they would like to write in word with their speech, instead of typing.</p>
											<p>The software that would be required to allow this project to take flight would involve a human language interface, automation and voice recognition software for Windows PC, as a starting point. This software would have to be multi-functional AI software that allows you to interact with your computer using voice commands in most of the languages of the world. It must be able to understand different speech patterns, accents and languages to gauge and react to the User’s prompts.</p>
											<p>The skill required to be involved in this project would involve strong coding knowledge and understanding, experience in coding and using AI, voice recognition software and knowledge and software development. It would be very feasible to find people whose skills and experience match this criterion as there are several UI’s of a similar nature.</p>
											<p>With a fully coherent and functional UI like described, the developmental impact would be immeasurable. By having a fully automated UI like this, it would open up technology as whole to a whole new audience, with less awkwardness or fear of use. This would increase functionality of different systems by tenfold, by allowing efficient ways for the User to interact with the systems and for the systems to learn and cater to the User. It would solve any previous problem for the visually impaired, allowing them to use a system almost to its full potential with little to no disadvantage compared to someone who is visually able. If this project is successful, we would be left with a life changing way to interact with the technology that surrounds us in this day and age. By having different systems understand prompts, it would eliminate the tedious tasks often found when manually handling something. This can be transferred to anything, from home appliances to a hands-free car experience.</p>
